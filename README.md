# M-L
This was my groups final project for the Video Game Design course offered by Friscoisd, this class was taught by Mr. Baker.
The game was created with two other developers adn placed second out of over 30 teams compeating 
during the 2018-2019 school year.
## How to use
In order to open the code you must have Microsoft's XNA Game engine installed, and Visual Studio 2015 or older, we do not have 
any copies of the compiled version of the game, so it needs to be run in the visual studio environment.
